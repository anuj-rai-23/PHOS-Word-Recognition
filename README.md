# PHOSC-Zero-Shot-Word-Recognition

![SPP-Pho(SC)Net Image](Images/Pho(SC)net_Architecture.png)

**PHOSNet** and **Pho(SC)Net** are convolution neural networks for characterizing document word images using proposed *PHOS* and *Pho(SC)* embedding, which can be used for word recognition in Zero-shot setting. This code was used for generating results for the work [Pho(SC)Net: An Approach Towards Zero-shot Word Image Recognition in Historical Documents](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86549-8_2).

Implemented using Tensorflow 2.x framework.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Tensorflow 2.x 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Files 
| File Name | Significance |
| ------ | ------ |
| Alphabet.csv | Stores count of primary shapes for alphabets |
| aug_images.py | Augmentation of the images in folder (also saves them in same folder)|
| phoc_label_generator.py | Generating PHOC vectors |
| phos_label_generator.py | Generating PHOS vectors |
| train_\<model\>.py | Training the model |
| test_\<model\>.py | Testing the performance of saved model |
> Saved model names follow a naming convention, i.e. *new_(model_identifier)_(batch_size)\_.h5*

#### Additional Directories generated after training/testing
| Directory | Significance |
| ------ | ------ |
| Train_History | Saves the training data (losses/similarities) for each epoch |
| Test_Results | Saves true and predicted labels for each sample in test set|
| Test_Plots | Saves plots generated by testing module|

>Plots generated during testing are named as follows: *(model_name)_(test_identifier)\_(test_setting).png*

>Test result files are named as follows: *(model_name)_(test_identifier)\_(test_setting).csv*
